# Problem statement

My goal is to find a way to accurately forecast fundraising revenue.

The existing model ("JMod") has two components. First, the probability a solicitation $S_{i}$ comes in before the end of the fiscal year is a function of the current stage progress $c$ and time until the end of the year $t$, $P(S_{i}=1)=f(c_{i},t)$. The expected FRP in the current fiscal year is this probability times the expected amount, $E(FRP)=P(S_{i}=1)E(S_{i})$, discounted to 0 if the expected close date is after the end of the fiscal year.

The probabilities are adjusted from year to year; these were the weights used in fiscal year 2015, 7/1/14 -- 6/30/15.

| Stage    | July-Feb| Mar-Apr |   May   |  June   |
|----------|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:| 
| Plan     |  1/6    | 1/8     | 0       |   0     |
| Clear    |  1/3    | 1/6     | 1/8     |   0     |
| Ask      |  2/3    | 1/3     | 1/6     |   1/8   |
| Oral     |  2/3    | 1/3     | 1/6     |   1/8   |
| Paperwork|  1      | 1       | 1       |   1     |

  * How accurate is this method?
  * Are all of these variables (expected amount, current date, expected date) predictive?
  * Are there additional variables that will improve the model's accuracy?
  * Is there an alternate model for $P(S_{i}=1)$ that performs better?

# Data

For model fitting and comparison, data was compiled on 1309 solicitations opened between 7/1/2011 and 3/15/2016 with known outcome (booked, refused, cancelled). 

For initial model validation, point-in-time data was compiled from 153 historical reports run between 

# Variable selection

Confidence bands are based on the standard error for a binomial random variable, $\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}$ (assuming independence).

Should treat Ask and Oral differently (AF/MG plots, with table)
